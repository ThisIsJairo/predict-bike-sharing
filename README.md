# predict-bike-sharing
This is the first project on the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree.

Here, I built my first neural network consisting in one hidden layer to predict share bike rental ridership.
This project did not leverage any deep learnign frameworks such as Pytorch or Keras/TensorFlow. 
So, I had the opportunity to create my own function to perform forward pass, backpropagation, weights update for training and testing the network.
